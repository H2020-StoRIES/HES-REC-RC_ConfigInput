  description: "`base_config_xls` specifies the main XLS configuration file name.\
    \ Users can modify this file to change the pipeline configuration. \n`base_config_yaml`\
    \ is initially empty; when the pipeline is executed, a YAML file with the same\
    \ base name as the XLS file is generated, and `base_config_yaml` is updated with\
    \ this name. \nIf `base_config_yaml` remains empty, it indicates that the YAML\
    \ file has not yet been generated. \nBoth `base_config_xls` and `base_config_yaml`\
    \ should share the same base name to ensure consistency.base_config:\n"
